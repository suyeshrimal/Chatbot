Users can upload documents (e.g. PDFs), and the chatbot can extract and answer questions based on the embedded content using a vector store and retrieval chain.

2. Appointment Booking Tool
Integrated agent tool to collect appointment-related information through conversation.

3. Persistent Chat History
Maintains chat history during a session to enable more coherent multi-turn conversations.

4. Input Validators
